# mindrepo

My goal with this repository is to externalize my thinking. It collects notes, discussions, AI 
interactions, and unfinished concepts in one searchable space.  
Some entries may grow into projects, others simply document moments of curiosity or learning.

This is the public subset of my originally private mind repo. I published these notes to showcase how I organize my thoughts in a way that is searchable by AI agents.

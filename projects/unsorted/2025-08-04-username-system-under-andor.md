---

# Context
This note defines a repeatable method to generate usernames that play on the similarity between "Andor" and the word "under". It also documents current handles by platform and a shortlist of future options.

# Content

## Core idea
- Replace occurrences of "under" in common phrases or compound words with "andor".
- Match the phrase to the platform’s context and tone.

## Patterns
- Phrase form: "under the X" → "andor the X".
- Single-word form: words prefixed by "under" (e.g., "understaffed") → drop "under" and prefix "andor" (→ "andorstaffed").

## Rules
- Prefer lowercase and no separators.
- Check readability, length, and ease of pronunciation.
- Keep meanings platform-appropriate.

## Inventory (current handles)
- Instagram: `andortheinfluence` → from "under the influence". Playful; social fit.
- GitHub: `andorthehood` → from "under the hood". Technical fit.
- Goodreads: `andorlineingeverything` → from "underlining everything". On-theme with reading.
- Facebook: `andorthewrongimpression` → from "under the wrong impression". Clear; long; casual fit.
- LinkedIn: `andorstaffed` → from "understaffed".
- X (Twitter): `andorstatement` → from "understatement". Clear; concise; news and commentary fit.
- Hugging Face: `andorfitting` → from "underfitting". Machine learning and model-sharing fit.

### Future options with categories
- `andorreview` (under review): code collaboration, Q&A, blog, newsletter, professional networking.
- `andorconsideration` (under consideration): professional networking, blog, personal site/portfolio.
- `andortheradar` (under the radar): social media, microblogging, video.
- `andortheweather` (under the weather): social media, microblogging, community/forums.
- `andorthetable` (under the table): social media, short video, personal site/portfolio.
- `pandoro`: social media, short video.

## Context

The following is the content of the README.md file I added to my internet time capsule.

# README

You've found my archive of images that I've collected from the internet over the last two decades. This is a record of what the internet once was—before algorithmic feeds, mass content moderation, and AI-generated media took over. If you're browsing through it, I hope you find something interesting!

## Sources and theme

My main sources were Flickr, Tumblr, Instagram, and personal websites of artists I liked. There's not really a common theme, but most images depict the lifestyle of people my age at the time (millennial teenagers and young adults) their living spaces, and their aesthetics. You'll also find a lot of erotic and weird artsy images, including not just photos but also mixed-media art, scrapbooks, and paintings.

## Categorising

After learning about the Dead Internet Theory in the early 2020s, I decided to categorize the images based on when I found and archived them. So the date only reflects when I added them to my collection, and not when they were originally created.

- **2006 - 2022:** All images in this folder are 100% human-made. While generative AI existed toward the end of this period, it was still in its early stages, and AI-generated images were obvious and easy to spot.
- **2023 - 2024:** This is when AI-generated images started becoming very good. They could still be identified if you looked at the backgrounds or counted fingers, but with enough editing, they could pass as real. I can't say with 100% confidence that there are no AI-generated images in this folder.
- **2025 - :** By 2025, distinguishing AI-generated images became much harder. Some were nearly indistinguishable from real ones, though getting photorealistic results still required a lot of tweaking. I did my best to filter them out, but at this point, the line between real and synthetic had become very thin.

## Note on ethics and preservation

The original creators of these images did not consent to me storing or archiving their work. In some cases, I downloaded images despite websites actively trying to prevent it. I understand that this raises ethical concerns, but my motivation has always been preservation. Over the years, platforms have purged content, shut down, or pushed users out, causing countless images disappearing forever:
- Tumblr's 2018 content purge deleted massive amounts of explicit and artistic content overnight.
- Flickr's 2019 and 2023 policy changes threatened to delete photos from free users unless they paid for a subscription, causing many to abandon or delete their accounts.
- Instagram frequently removes content due to censorship, algorithm changes, or account deletions.

And I believe this will keep happening. As platforms shift their business models and prioritize advertisers, more images will disappear. It's sad that the internet isn't as permanent as we once thought.

## Cultural bias discalimer

This archive has a racial and cultural bias towards white people and western culture. This is not intentional, but a result of:
- The fact that I am from this cultural circle.
- The websites I collected images from (Flickr, Tumblr, Instagram) were moslty used by white western people at the time.
Because of this, the archive is not fully representative of a broader global internet culture, and certain perspectives or aesthetics may be underrepresented.

## Trigger warning

This archive contains a wide variety of images, some of which might be disturbing, unsettling. This includes:
- Nudity in various contexts, including artistic, cultural, and documentary depictions.
- Erotic and explicit content. (I consider most of them artistic, but that's debateble.)
- Bodily fluids, including but not limited to blood, sweat, saliva, and other organic substances.
- Surreal, disturbing, or horror-inspired images.
- Medical or body horror elements.
- Images related to death, mourning, and funerary practices, including cemeteries and memorials.
- Blasphemy, religious satire, or anti-religious themes.
- Images related to the occult, esoteric practices, witchcraft, Tarot, or mystical symbolism.
- Political opinions that were controversial at the time and may still be.
- Imagery related to protests, riots, war, or political conflicts, including depictions of violence and civil unrest.
- Firearms, weapons, and images related to gun culture.
- Depictions of behaviors that were, and may still be, considered deviant.
- Content exploring sexuality, gender identity, and nonconventional relationships.
- Severed body parts of animals that were considered edible/food at the time.
- Images of insects, taxidermy, animal carcasses, or biological specimens.
- Depictions of substance use, including alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, and potentially other drugs.
- Images related to self-harm, depression, or mental health struggles (especially images from the Tumblr era).
- Depictions of unconventional expectations of human bodies, including body hair, fat, and other physical traits that challenge mainstream beauty standards.
- One or two images contain the "circle game" hand sign, where forming a circle with the thumb and index finger is meant to trick people into looking.

All nudity and sexual content in this archive features consenting adults. Whenever I had a slight doubt about consent, legality, or ethical concerns, I chose not to archive the image.

If you're looking at this archive decades or centuries from now, you might find some of its content offensive, outdated, or even shocking by your standards. This archive reflects how the internet was during the 2000s–2020s, not how it should be viewed in the future. You may encounter images that:
- Depict outdated beauty standards or body expectations that may no longer align with future cultural norms.
- Lack representation of certain groups or perspectives due to the biases of the internet communities where they were collected.
- Depict everyday behaviors that may have become taboo (such as consuming meat, alcohol, tobacco, or using certain materials).
- Were archived without explicit consent, which might be seen as unethical under future standards of digital ownership and privacy.
- Make a distinction between human-made and AI-generated art, which may seem irrelevant or unnecessary in an era where AI creativity is fully accepted.
- Include political views or historical narratives that may be restricted, censored, or reinterpreted in the future.
- Contain humor, memes, or internet references that may not translate well or have taken on different meanings over time.
- Show outdated technology, brands, or platforms that may be viewed as symbols of a past society with different values.
- Portray relationships, gender roles, or social dynamics that could seem oversimplified or problematic by future perspectives.

## Technical notes

- The image file names are their SHA-1 hashes.
- The modification dates on some files might suggest they were archived later than the categories they're in. This is just a side effect of copying and moving them across different file systems and network storages over the years.
- The three main category folders contain numbered subfolders, each with 1,000 images. The reason for this is that some operating systems struggle with handling 100,000+ image files in a single folder.
- The images are in no particular order, they were randomly assigned to subfolders during sorting, so there is no intentional grouping or thematic organization.
- If you found this archive on a hard drive, you may notice multiple copies of the same folder structure and images. This was intentional to prevent data loss due to data rot.

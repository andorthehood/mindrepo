I’m not religious, but I’m curious about different religious traditions, and I find religious texts such as the Bible interesting, because they are often referenced in literature and other cultural works.

I read it casually from time to time, and when I stumble upon something interesting, I look up its meaning or symbolism and save my notes in this folder.

# Context
This note collects UX and UI principles that I find clear, practical, and worth reusing in my own work.
It starts with the Principle of Least Surprise and can grow over time as I notice patterns that make interfaces easier to understand and use.

## Principle of Least Surprise
The Principle of Least Surprise means designing interfaces and interactions so that they match the most reasonable expectations of the people using them.
When this principle holds, users can usually guess what will happen when they click, tap, type, or navigate, based on their experience with similar products and with the rest of the interface.

- The goal is to minimise unexpected or confusing behaviour in the user interface.
- It applies to layout, control behaviour, labels, navigation, error messages, and visual feedback.
- It is relative to the local norms of a platform and product, not to an abstract global standard.

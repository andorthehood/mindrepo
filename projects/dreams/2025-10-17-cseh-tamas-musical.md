I dreamed that I was directing and writing a musical built around the songs of Cseh Tamás. The story wasn’t about him directly but about a group of drama students trying to create a musical using his songs.

The play unfolded in fragments, just like his music. I never saw the full production, only moments: someone singing on stage, others arguing over lyrics, laughter, frustration, affection. It was about their artistic struggle and the connections between them.

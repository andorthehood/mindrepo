# Context
I want a single place to track electronic components that I regularly need so that I can keep them in stock and avoid blocking projects while waiting for parts.

# Content

## General preferences
- I have a large number of 2.54 mm raster prototyping PCBs, so I prefer components with 2.54 mm pin pitch or simple multiples like 5.08 mm when possible.

## Capacitors
- 2.2 µF ceramic capacitors, ≥10 V (25 V preferred), ±10 %, radial leaded preferred, axial leaded acceptable
- 4.7 µF ceramic capacitors, ≥10 V (25 V preferred), ±10 %, radial leaded preferred, axial leaded acceptable
- 100 pF ceramic capacitors, ≥10 V (25 V preferred), ±10 %, radial leaded preferred, axial leaded acceptable
- 1000 pF ceramic capacitors, ≥10 V (25 V preferred), ±10 %, radial leaded preferred, axial leaded acceptable
- 2200 pF ceramic capacitors, ≥10 V (25 V preferred), ±10 %, radial leaded preferred, axial leaded acceptable

## Connectors
- Wire-to-board terminal blocks, 2–10 ways, 2.54 mm leg spacing (pin pitch)

## Op-amps
- MCP6021 rail-to-rail op-amp, DIP package only (through-hole)
- MCP6022 dual rail-to-rail op-amp, DIP package only (through-hole)
- MCP6024 quad rail-to-rail op-amp, DIP package only (through-hole)

## Resistors
- 1 MΩ resistors, ≤1 W power rating, ≤1 % tolerance
- 2 MΩ resistors, ≤1 W power rating, ≤1 % tolerance

# Observation: Tests Are the Price of Vibe Coding

The usual story with vibe-coded apps: they reach an impressive prototype stage fast, but then fall apart the moment the AI agent is asked for new features.

I’ve watched a few of these projects led by people with no software background, and their failures were almost always preventable with tests. The problem is, many of them have never even heard of software testing. To them, “it runs” means “it works,” and that’s as far as the concept of reliability goes.

Of course the agent keeps shipping confident changes, but without a suite to catch regressions, something breaks quietly, and no one notices until it’s too late.

There are a few tools now that actually add tests at the beginning, but when one fails, it just deletes or skips it, proudly reporting a “green” suite again. Without someone who realizes that “fix” really means “turned off the test,” the project drifts right back into untested territory.

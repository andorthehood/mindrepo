## Wondering statement

I was wondering whether tinnitus produces a constant frequency, and if it has a stable pitch, could it serve as a reference tone for musical tuning by measuring intervals?

## Findings

Tinnitus can produce a constant frequency (like a pure tone), but that’s just one of several possible forms. There are a few main types, depending on the cause and the part of the auditory system affected:

- **Tonal tinnitus** – This is what most people think of: a steady tone at a specific pitch (for example, a constant high-pitched ringing or whistling). It can be very stable over time or shift slightly in frequency or intensity.
- **Non-tonal tinnitus** – Instead of a single frequency, people might hear:
  - Hissing or static-like noise (broadband)
  - Clicking, crackling, or pulsing (rhythmic or irregular)
  - Whooshing or roaring sounds (often linked to vascular or muscular causes)
- **Pulsatile tinnitus** – Syncs with the heartbeat or blood flow, so it’s not constant in frequency or timing.
- **Somatic tinnitus** – Can vary depending on jaw movement, neck tension, or body position; frequency and intensity may shift dynamically.

In short:

- If the tinnitus originates from damage or hyperactivity in a narrow band of auditory neurons (like after loud noise exposure), it often manifests as a **constant-frequency tone**.
- If it’s caused by broader or mechanical factors (for example, middle ear muscle spasms, vascular noise, or nerve compression), it may **change over time** or have **no clear single frequency**.

Because of these differences, tinnitus rarely offers a perfectly stable pitch. Some listeners perceive a pure tone, but the sound often fluctuates in pitch and loudness, may break into multiple simultaneous tones, or resemble broadband noise. The perceived pitch also drifts with factors such as stress, fatigue, posture, diet, and surrounding sound, so attempting to match musical intervals to it yields inconsistent results from moment to moment.  

Audiology clinics sometimes perform **pitch-matching exercises** for therapy, yet even under controlled settings the matched pitch tends to wander within minutes. Because of this instability, an **external tuner or fixed-pitch instrument** remains the reliable option for musical tuning.

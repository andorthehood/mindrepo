---

# Context
This note defines a repeatable method to generate usernames that play on the similarity between "Andor" and the word "under". It also documents current handles by platform and a shortlist of future options.

# Content

## Core idea
- Replace occurrences of "under" in common phrases or compound words with "andor".
- Match the phrase to the platform’s context and tone.

## Patterns
- Phrase form: "under the X" → "andor the X".
- Single-word form: words prefixed by "under" (e.g., "understaffed") → drop "under" and prefix "andor" (→ "andorstaffed").

## Rules
- Prefer lowercase and no separators.
- Check readability, length, and ease of pronunciation.
- Keep meanings platform-appropriate.

## Inventory (current handles)
- Instagram: `andortheinfluence` → from "under the influence". Playful; social fit.
- GitHub: `andorthehood` → from "under the hood". Technical fit.
- Goodreads: `andorlineingeverything` → from "underlining everything". On-theme with reading; long and harder to parse.
- Facebook: `andorthewrongimpression` → from "under the wrong impression". Clear; long; casual fit.
- LinkedIn: `andorstaffed` → from "understaffed".

## Future options
- Professional: `andorreview` (under review), `andorconsideration` (under consideration).
- Creative/Social: `andortheradar` (under the radar), `andortheweather` (under the weather), `andorthetable` (under the table), `pandoro`, `andorwhelming` (underwhelming).

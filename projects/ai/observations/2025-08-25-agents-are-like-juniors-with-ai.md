After using GitHub’s coding agent for a few days, I realised it’s like working with a junior developer who has access to AI coding tools.

They can:
- Write a lot of code quickly.
- Seem surprisingly competent at first glance.
- But make architectural or contextual mistakes because they don’t fully understand the system or its long-term consequences.
- They’ll confidently push something that works but doesn’t fit, or they’ll overfit to examples without grasping the why.

# Perceived Less-Manly Catalogue

This list captures claims I ran across about everyday choices or behaviors that some people framed as making a man “less manly” or even “gay.”

I started collecting them around 2010 after hearing them from friends, relatives, acquaintances, overheard conversations, and various internet forums.

I record them here as a social curiosity, not as endorsements, and I don’t view any of these behaviors as wrong, although the people who said these painted them as some kind of wrongdoings.

Entries appear in the order I encountered them, earliest to latest.

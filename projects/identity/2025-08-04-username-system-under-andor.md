summary: Define a method to create platform usernames by swapping "under" with "andor" in fitting phrases; record current handles and future options.
---

# Context
This note defines a repeatable method to generate usernames that play on the similarity between "Andor" and the word "under". It also documents current handles by platform and a shortlist of future options.

# Content

## Core idea
- Replace occurrences of "under" in common phrases or compound words with "andor".
- Match the phrase to the platform’s context and tone.

## Patterns
- Phrase form: "under the X" → "andor the X".
- Single-word form: words prefixed by "under" (e.g., "understaffed") → drop "under" and prefix "andor" (→ "andorstaffed").

## Rules
- Prefer lowercase and no separators.
- Check readability, length, and ease of pronunciation.
- Keep meanings platform-appropriate.
- Base each username on an expression, collocation, or word that already exists in real usage (for example, idioms like "under the hood" or single words like "understaffed").
- Use only source phrases or words that already exist as natural "under" expressions (for example, "under the hood", "under review", "understaffed", "underwhelming").
- Do not create new or unnatural "under X" expressions  that no one actually says (for example, "under the frontend"); if the source expression is not natural, skip it.
- When you propose a username, also show the original "under" expression it comes from.
- Prefer usernames whose original expressions match the platform’s context (for example, technical phrases for developer platforms, reading-related phrases for book platforms).

## Inventory (current handles)
- Instagram: `andortheinfluence` → from "under the influence". Rationale: influence → influencer.
- Untappd: `andortheinfluence` → from "under the influence". On-theme for beer check-ins; matches Instagram.
- GitHub: `andorthehood` → from "under the hood". Technical fit.
- Goodreads: `andorlineingeverything` → from "underlining everything". On-theme with reading.
- Facebook: `andorthewrongimpression` → from "under the wrong impression". Clear; long; casual fit.
- LinkedIn: `andorstaffed` → from "understaffed".
- X (Twitter): `andorstatement` → from "understatement". Clear; concise; news and commentary fit.
- Hugging Face: `andorfitting` → from "underfitting". Machine learning and model-sharing fit.
- Google Developers: `andorconstruction` → from "under construction". Fits developer profiles, in-progress projects, and tooling work.

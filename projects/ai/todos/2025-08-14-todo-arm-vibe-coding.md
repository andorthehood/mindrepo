# TODO: ARM Assembly Vibe Coding Experiment

## Overview
Start a vibe coding project that uses an assembly language so the entire build leans on AI copilots instead of my personal knowledge. (I'm not fluent in x86 and ARM assembly languages.)

## Motivation
Simulate how non-developers vibe code whole applications by trusting AI-generated snippets they barely understand to better empathize with that workflow and document the friction.

## Experiment Sketch
- Build a tiny static site generator with minimal upfront research.
- Let AI agents propose the assembly code; accept or adapt their output even when it feels opaque.
- Screen record the whole session to capture confusion, surprising wins, and the learning curve.

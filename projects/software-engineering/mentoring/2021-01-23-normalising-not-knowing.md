summary: I reassure mentees that not knowing is normal, and I model how to investigate unknowns so learning feels safe and expected.

# Context
When mentoring, I want people to feel safe admitting uncertainty. Most growth comes from encountering gaps, naming them plainly, and learning in public.

# Content
- I’ve noticed many people are afraid to admit they don’t know something, because they’ve learned to associate “not knowing” (especially certain “obvious” topics) with shame.
- I explicitly say it’s okay to not know things (including “basic” things).
- I treat “I don’t know” as useful information, not a failure.
- To reinforce this, I’ll sometimes pick something I genuinely have no idea about and show my process of figuring it out (live, step by step).
- I narrate my process: clarify the question, identify constraints, form a hypothesis, find authoritative sources (docs/specs/code), test/verify, and write down what we learned.
- I normalise that investigation can look messy (wrong turns, revising assumptions) and that this is part of being effective.

# Next Steps
- Add 1–2 concrete examples where I modelled investigation (what we did, what we learned).
- Add “how to ask good questions” prompts I can reuse during sessions.

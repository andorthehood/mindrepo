# Context
This note collects favorite quotes related to identity.

# Content

## Philosophy
> "Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn't go away."
> — Philip K. Dick, "How to Build a Universe That Doesn't Fall Apart Two Days Later" (1978 essay).

> "The literal meaning of life is whatever you’re doing that prevents you from killing yourself."
> — Albert Camus (attributed; exact source disputed; the quote seems to be apocryphal, a memorable paraphrase summarizing Camus’s existential-absurd ideas rather than a direct citation, and this exact wording does not appear in any French edition of his work)

> "God is the name of the blanket we throw over the mystery to give it shape."
> — Barry Taylor (AC/DC's road manager)

## Work
> "Hired many, fired few. Made money. Lost money. Learned to stop counting."
> — Michael G. Scott (fictional character, From a deleted scene of The Office (US))

> "Talent hits a target no one else can hit; Genius hits a target no one else can see."
> Original German: Das Talent gleicht dem Schützen, der ein Ziel trifft, welches die Übrigen nicht erreichen können; das Genie dem, der eines trifft, bis zu welchem sie nicht einmal zu sehn vermögen.
> — Arthur Schopenhauer

> "My cofounder said yes to Meta, and as a result he was able to enjoy a lot of near-term liquidity."
> — Ilya Sutskever (This is a very polite way to say that his cofounder sold out, prioritizing near-term personal financial gain in a way that could be seen as betraying previous principles.)

## Technology
> "Once, men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would set them free. But that only permitted other men with machines to enslave them."
> — Frank Herbert, Dune (1965)

> "Because we do not understand the brain very well we are constantly tempted to use the latest technology as a model for trying to understand it. In my childhood we were always assured that the brain was a telephone switchboard. ('What else could it be?') I was amused to see that Sherrington, the great British neuroscientist, thought that the brain worked like a telegraph system. Freud often compared the brain to hydraulic and electro-magnetic systems. Leibniz compared it to a mill, and I am told some of the ancient Greeks thought the brain functions like a catapult. At present, obviously, the metaphor is the digital computer."
> — John R. Searle, Minds, Brains and Science, p. 44
